# NarrativeVisualization

This visualization project uses the 'Population of All US Cities 2024' dataset, which gives information about the population of 300 popular U.S. cities in the years 2020 and 2024. The data is visualized in order to show the geographical information of each city, as well as how the population changes within 4 years. By giving out the overviews of population changes and population information in each city. This narrative visualization can be useful for selecting work locations or for academic purposes or other usages.
This narrative visualization follows the interactive slideshow. There are three slides in total, which are "Area vs Population in 2020" (default showing), "Area vs Population in 2024", and "City Population Trends" (annual change of population in each city between 2020 and 2024). These graphs are overviews of population changes and population information in each city. Hopefully, this website can be useful for selecting work locations or for academic purposes or other usages. Moving from slide to slide, the user can first observe population information in 2020 for each city, and then observe similar information in 2024. Lastly, users can find information about annual changes in these cities from 2020 to 2024. Users can look for details for each census region, such as Western, Midwestern, Southern, and Eastern States, as well as more specific regions like the Pacific States, etc. by simply mouse over the legends beside the graph (trigger this when hovering/un-hovering the legend of the region). There are select buttons for those regions, user can always drill down into some details by clicking each button. Each scene is a slide, and each slide only contains a chart, with descriptions as well as drill-down details. It keeps user-oriented and clear.
The annotation in this narrative visualization is simple. They show the details for cities with maximum population density and minimum population density. Scenes one and two have different annotations, and the annotations will be cleared and redrew when the user selects different census regions (annotations will then show the details for those cities within the selected regions). Therefore, annotation will change within a scene and between scenes.
Parameters include three slide numbers that control the scenes. Selected census regions are parameters, controlled by the buttons, that would help the user select regions. In the third scene, there are parameters controlling how the data should be sorted, which would give users different views of the bar charts.
Mouse over the legends can change hidden parameters, which would trigger the highlight function. This function would show the highlighted cities in the hovered census region. Scene number changes can trigger changes in the visibilities of different texts, graphs, as well as buttons. Different buttons click would trigger different parameters to change, making annotations to change as well as the data points to change within the graphs.
