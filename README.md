This visualization project uses the 'Population of All US Cities 2024' dataset, which provides information about the population of 300 popular U.S. cities in the years 2020 and 2024. The data is visualized to show the geographical information of each city and how the population changes over four years. By providing overviews of population changes and population information for each city, this narrative visualization can be useful for selecting work locations, academic purposes, or other uses.

This narrative visualization follows an interactive slideshow format. There are three slides in total: "Area vs Population in 2020" (default view), "Area vs Population in 2024", and "City Population Trends" (annual population change in each city between 2020 and 2024). These graphs provide overviews of population changes and population information for each city.

Moving from slide to slide, users can first observe population information for 2020 for each city, then similar information for 2024 in the next slide. Lastly in the third slide, users can find information about annual changes in these cities from 2020 to 2024. Besides, there are select buttons for census regions, allowing users to drill down into more information by clicking each button. Users can look for details for each census region, such as Western, Midwestern, Southern, and Eastern States, as well as more specific regions like the Pacific States or South Atlantic States, by simply mousing over the legends beside the graph (triggered by hovering/un-hovering the legend of the region). Each scene is a slide, and each slide contains a chart, with descriptions and drill-down details. Therefore, it keeps user-oriented and clear.

The annotations in this narrative visualization are simple. They show the details for cities with maximum and minimum population density. Scenes one and two have different annotations because the targeted cities might be different, and the annotations will be cleared and redrawn when the user selects different census regions (annotations will then show the details for those cities within the selected regions). Thus, annotations will change within a scene and between scenes.

Parameters include three slide numbers that control the scenes. Selected census regions are parameters controlled by the buttons, which help the user select regions. In the third scene, there are parameters controlling how the data should be sorted, giving users different views of the bar charts.

Mousing over the legends can change hidden parameters, which trigger the highlight function. This function highlights cities in the hovered census region, controlled by the opacity parameters of each data point. Therefore, the unselected cities have lighter colors and are more secretive. Scene number changes can trigger changes in the visibility of different texts, graphs, as well as buttons. Different button clicks trigger different parameters to change, making annotations to change as well as the data points within the graphs.
